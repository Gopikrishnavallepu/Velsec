## SECTION 1: WHAT YOU ALREADY LEARNED — JD Requirement by Requirement

---

### ✅ 1. "Manage security findings, alerts, and exceptions across CSPM, CWPP"

**You know this well. Here's where you learned it:**

| What You Learned | Where |
|-----------------|-------|
| CSPM investigation workflow (filter → examine → remediate/suppress/accept) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.2 |
| CWPP runtime detection investigation (process tree, drift, network) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.3 |
| TP vs FP decision framework (context → process tree → correlation) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 5.1 |
| Risk acceptance process (document → approve → expiry → review) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 5.3 |
| Suppression rules with justification, scope, expiry, reviewer | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 5.2 |
| IOA vs IOC vs IOM differences | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Q10 |
| 20 incident scenarios with console navigation | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 4 |
| 10 PSS misconfigurations with detection + remediation | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.8 |
| Alert fatigue management | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Q9 |

**Wells Fargo Twist:** They use **Wiz** not CrowdStrike. But concepts are identical — you already know the Wiz comparison from Part1 Section 2.3. The key difference: Wiz is 100% agentless (snapshot-based), no runtime sensor.

---

### ✅ 2. "Cloud security misconfigurations across Azure and GCP — IAM, network, storage, VM hardening"

**You know the concepts. Here's what maps:**

| What You Learned | Where |
|-----------------|-------|
| CSPM finding types (open SGs, unencrypted storage, IAM misconfigs) | `EY_Prep.md` Section 3 |
| Multi-cloud security controls matrix (AWS/Azure/GCP) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 2.4 |
| CIS AWS Benchmarks (detailed control-level) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 6.1 |
| CIS EKS Benchmarks (12 key controls) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 6.1 |
| NIST 800-53 → cloud control mapping | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 6.2 |
| IAM privilege escalation paths (12 paths) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 10 |
| False positive investigation process | `EY_Prep.md` Section 3 Q2 |
| S3/SG/IAM misconfigurations with remediation | `Advanced_Study_Guide.md`, `EY_Prep.md` |
| Azure NSG audit (PowerShell script) | `EY_Prep.md` Section 11 |
| Azure compliance report (PowerShell) | `Automation_Scripts.md` Script 5 (PowerShell) |

**⚠️ Gap:** Your materials are **heavily AWS-focused**. Wells Fargo specifically asks for **Azure and GCP**. You need to study:
- Azure: NSGs, Azure Policy, Key Vault, Defender for Cloud, Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Storage Account security
- GCP: Firewall Rules, Organization Policies, Cloud KMS, SCC (Security Command Center), IAM Recommender

---

### ✅ 3. "Vulnerability management lifecycle — compliance & vulnerability scanning for containers/Kubernetes"

**Strongly covered:**

| What You Learned | Where |
|-----------------|-------|
| 6-phase vuln lifecycle (Discover → Assess → Prioritize → Remediate → Verify → Report) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.1 |
| SLA framework (severity × exposure × data sensitivity) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.5 |
| SLA escalation chain (50% → 75% → 100% → 150%) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.5 |
| Image assessment workflow | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 2.2 |
| Build-breaking policies (CI/CD security gates) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.7 |
| Container security lifecycle (build → registry → admit → runtime → network) | `EY_Prep.md` Section 6 |

| Automated SLA tracker script | `Automation_Scripts.md` Script 5 |

---

### ✅ 4. "Wiz (attack paths, compliance issues, CCR)"

**Partially covered — you know the concepts, need Wiz-specific UI knowledge:**

| What You Learned | Where |
|-----------------|-------|
| CNAPP tool comparison (CrowdStrike vs Orca vs **Wiz** vs Prisma) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 2.3 |
| Attack path analysis (Cloud Risks in Falcon = Attack Path in Wiz) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 2.2 |
| Compliance framework mapping (CIS, NIST, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI) | `Ultimate_Prep_Part2.md` Section 6 |

**What you know about Wiz specifically:**
- 100% agentless via snapshot scanning
- Strong CSPM, CIEM, DSPM, IaC scanning
- Excellent attack path visualization (graph-based)
- Risk prioritization via "toxic combinations"

**⚠️ Gap:** You haven't studied the **Wiz console UI** specifically. Key Wiz concepts to learn:
- **Wiz Issues** = their version of findings/IOMs

**⚠️ Gap:** You need Splunk-specific skills:
- SPL (Search Processing Language) for log queries
- Splunk dashboards for security KPIs
- Alert configuration and notable events
- CIM (Common Information Model) for data normalization
- Correlation searches and data models

---

### ✅ 6. "SLA tracking reviews, escalations with application teams"

**Well covered from EY prep:**

| Runbook updates as post-incident activity | `Ultimate_Prep_Part1.md` Section 3.4 Phase 6 |
| 30-60-90 day plan includes "Document all processes" | `EY_Prep.md` Section 15 |

---

## SECTION 2: WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN — THE GAPS

### ❌ GAP 1: Power BI / DAX / Power Query (CRITICAL — Required Qualification)

**Why Wells Fargo needs this:** They track cloud security KPIs via Power BI dashboards. The FM team builds datasets from Wiz APIs, CSVs, and databases to create executive reports.

**What to learn:**
```
POWER BI LEARNING PATH:
├── 1. Power BI Desktop basics (drag-and-drop reports, visuals)
├── 2. Power Query (M-language) — connect to CSV, API, database
│   ├── Data cleaning: remove nulls, split columns, merge queries
│   ├── Data shaping: pivot/unpivot, group by, add custom columns
│   └── Incremental refresh for large datasets
├── 3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
│   ├── Measures: CALCULATE, FILTER, SUMX, COUNTROWS
│   ├── Time intelligence: DATEADD, TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR
│   ├── Context: row context vs filter context
│   └── KPI measures: SLA compliance %, MTTR, finding age distribution
├── 4. Data modeling
│   ├── Star schema (fact tables + dimension tables)
│   ├── Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
│   └── Role-level security (RLS) for team-specific views
└── 5. Security-specific dashboards
    ├── Finding count by severity over time
    ├── SLA compliance by team / cloud account
    ├── MTTR trends
    ├── Compliance score by framework
    └── Coverage gaps by region / account
```

**Sample DAX you should know:**
```
SLA_Compliance_Rate =
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Findings, Findings[SLA_Status] = "On Track")),
    COUNTROWS(Findings),
    0
) * 100

Open_Critical_Findings =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Findings),
    Findings[Severity] = "CRITICAL",
    Findings[Status] = "Open"
)

MTTR_Days =
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(Findings, Findings[Status] = "Closed"),
    DATEDIFF(Findings[Created_Date], Findings[Closed_Date], DAY)
)
```

---

### ❌ GAP 2: Excel Advanced (Required Qualification)

**What to learn:**
```
EXCEL SKILLS NEEDED:
├── VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP — match findings to asset owners by asset ID
├── INDEX-MATCH — flexible lookup across large datasets
├── PivotTables — summarize findings by severity, team, cloud account
├── Power Query in Excel — same transformations as Power BI
├── Conditional Formatting — heatmaps for SLA status
└── Data Validation — dropdown lists for triage status updates
```

**Example use case:** You receive a CSV with 5,000 Wiz findings. You need to:
1. XLOOKUP the asset owner from a CMDB export
2. PivotTable to show finding count by severity × team
3. Conditional formatting to highlight SLA-breached items in red
4. Power Query to merge with last month's data for trend analysis

---

### ❌ GAP 3: ServiceNow (CMDB, Workflows, Ticket Management)

**What to learn:**
```
SERVICENOW SKILLS NEEDED:
├── CMDB (Configuration Management Database)
│   ├── What it stores: all IT assets with owners, environments, relationships
│   ├── CI (Configuration Item) validation: is the asset in CMDB?
│   ├── Ownership mapping: which team owns this resource?
│   └── CMDB hygiene: stale CIs, missing owners, orphaned assets
├── Incident / Change Management
│   ├── Ticket creation from security findings
│   ├── Assignment groups and routing logic
│   ├── SLA timers and escalation rules
│   └── Change request processing for remediation
├── Workflows
│   ├── Automated ticket routing based on asset tags / cloud account
│   ├── Approval workflows for risk acceptance
│   └── Auto-closure when CNAPP confirms remediation
└── Reporting
    ├── ServiceNow dashboards for security metrics
    ├── CMDB coverage reports
    └── SLA compliance tracking
```

---

### ❌ GAP 4: SQL Queries for Dashboards

**What to learn:**
```sql
-- Example: Finding count by severity and cloud account
SELECT severity, cloud_account, COUNT(*) as finding_count
FROM wiz_findings
WHERE status = 'Open'
GROUP BY severity, cloud_account
ORDER BY 
  CASE severity WHEN 'CRITICAL' THEN 1 WHEN 'HIGH' THEN 2 
       WHEN 'MEDIUM' THEN 3 ELSE 4 END;

-- Example: SLA compliance by team
SELECT team, 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN sla_status = 'On Track' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as on_track,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN sla_status = 'On Track' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 
        / COUNT(*), 1) as compliance_pct
FROM findings
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY compliance_pct ASC;

-- Example: MTTR by severity
SELECT severity,
  AVG(DATEDIFF(day, created_date, closed_date)) as avg_mttr_days,
  MAX(DATEDIFF(day, created_date, closed_date)) as max_mttr_days
FROM findings WHERE status = 'Closed'
GROUP BY severity;
```
