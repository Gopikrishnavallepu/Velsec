# PART 1: RESPONSIBILITY → EVIDENCE MAPPING

## How Each Job Responsibility is Proven by the PowerBI Project

| # | Job Responsibility | Evidence in PowerBI_Project | File(s) |
|---|-------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| **1** | Manage security findings, alerts, and exceptions across CSPM, CWPP, vulnerability management platforms, Splunk, and Wiz (attack paths, compliance, CCR) — ensuring accurate triage, routing, and follow-up | ✅ **Fully covered.** The entire project revolves around ingesting Wiz findings (50 records: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), calculating SLA status (Breached/At-Risk/On-Track), and routing to assignment groups via CMDB join. The `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` has a Security Score formula (37/100), SLA compliance tracking (48%), and an Owner Accountability Matrix showing who is behind. The severity-based triage logic (CRITICAL=24h SLA, HIGH=168h, MEDIUM=720h, LOW=2160h) mirrors real CSPM triage workflows. | `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (DAX measures L226-362), `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` (Pages 1-3), `wiz_findings.csv` |
| **2** | Perform advanced data analysis for deduplication, correlation, and bulk updates — working with large datasets from CSVs, APIs, and cloud logs | ✅ **Fully covered.** Power Query transformations deduplicate and correlate data across 3 sources. `Live_Data_Pipeline_Guide.md` shows Python ETL pulling from Wiz GraphQL API (paginated, 500/page), SQL CMDB (direct query), and ServiceNow REST API (paginated, 10K/page). Data is joined on `resource_id` and `finding_id` keys. Bulk updates via TRUNCATE+INSERT pattern. | `Live_Data_Pipeline_Guide.md` (Parts 4-5), `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (Power Query L66-156) |
| **3** | Build and maintain Power BI dashboards and reports — dataset connections, DAX development, and Power Query (M-language) transformations for security and inventory data | ✅ **Core deliverable.** PROJECT_GUIDE has 20+ DAX measures (CALCULATE, AVERAGEX, DATESMTD, DIVIDE, SUMX, FILTER). Power Query M-language shown with 7 custom columns (Age_Days, SLA_Days, SLA_Pct_Used, SLA_Status, Age_Bucket, Severity_Order). Executive Dashboard Guide adds 20 more DAX measures including Security Score, Net Change, Risk Score, MTTR Critical/High. 3-page dashboard with dark theme, conditional formatting, drill-through. | `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (L207-383), `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` (L231-387) |
| **4** | Extract, clean, and shape data using Excel (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, PivotTables, Power Query, Index-Match, conditional formatting) for analysis, reporting, and audit preparation | ✅ **Partially covered via Power BI equivalent** + **Fully covered in separate Excel tutorial.** The Power Query transformations in the project mirror Excel Power Query exactly. The Excel_Data_Analysis_Complete_Tutorial.md covers VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, PivotTables, conditional formatting, and audit-style reports. For the PowerBI project specifically, conditional formatting is used on all 3 dashboard pages (severity colors, SLA status colors, age color scales). | `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (Power Query section), `Excel_Data_Analysis_Complete_Tutorial.md` |
| **5** | Integrate data from databases into Power BI — SQL queries, building relationships, applying incremental refresh, and modeling data for cloud security KPIs and dashboards | ✅ **Fully covered.** `Live_Data_Pipeline_Guide.md` has complete SQL DDL (CREATE TABLE) for 4 tables + Python SQL queries for CMDB extraction. `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` shows data model relationships (wiz_findings ↔ cmdb_assets M:1, wiz_findings ↔ servicenow_tickets 1:1) plus a DAX-generated Date Table with time intelligence functions (DATESMTD, DATEADD). Star schema architecture documented. | `Live_Data_Pipeline_Guide.md` (Part 3), `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (L160-203) |
| **6** | Manage workflow and ownership mapping in ServiceNow — CMDB validation, ticket routing logic, change request processing, and inventory verification across Azure, GCP | ✅ **Fully covered.** `cmdb_assets.csv` has 30 assets with owner, assignment_group, business_unit, environment, and cloud_provider fields across Azure and GCP. `servicenow_tickets.csv` has 50 tickets with assignment_group, ticket routing to 6 teams, change_request_id field, and SLA tracking. The Owner Accountability Matrix on Page 3 shows CMDB validation by cross-referencing owners with finding counts and SLA performance. | `cmdb_assets.csv`, `servicenow_tickets.csv`, `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` (L693-702) |
| **7** | Lead recurring customer engagement — weekly office hours, remediation meetings, SLA tracking reviews, and escalations with application teams and engineering partners | ✅ **Covered by dashboard outputs.** The 3-page dashboard IS the artifact you present in weekly/monthly reviews. Page 1 (Executive Risk Overview) = CISO monthly review. Page 2 (SLA & Remediation Operations) = weekly remediation meeting with teams. Page 3 (Owner Accountability Matrix) = escalation tracking. The 30-60-90 day improvement roadmap in `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` maps to recurring engagement cadence. | `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` (Parts 4-5, L840-910) |
| **8** | Create and maintain documentation, SOPs, KB articles, and remediation guides for governance, onboarding, and repeatable operational processes | ✅ **Fully covered.** The 3 guides ARE operational documentation: `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` = SOP for dashboard build (step-by-step, reproducible). `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` = governance reporting SOP. `Live_Data_Pipeline_Guide.md` = data pipeline KB article with troubleshooting, security checklist, and interview Q&A. All include checklists for completeness verification. | All 3 `.md` files |
| **9** | Review and validate cloud security misconfigurations across Azure and GCP — IAM, network, storage, VM hardening, and compliance controls | ✅ **Fully covered by data.** `wiz_findings.csv` contains findings across 7 categories: Network (NSG SSH 0.0.0.0/0, NSG All Inbound), IAM (MFA Not Enforced, Service Account Owner Role), Storage (Blob Public Access, GCS Uniform Access), Container (AKS Privileged Pods, GKE Legacy ABAC), Compute (VM Disk Encryption), Encryption (Key Vault Soft Delete), Database (SQL TDE). Both Azure and GCP findings with CIS benchmark mapping. | `wiz_findings.csv`, `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` (Page 3 CIS Benchmark Gaps) |
| **10** | Collaborate with cross-functional teams (SecOps, Cloud Engineering, Platform Owners) to track remediation progress, clarify ownership boundaries, and ensure accurate closure of exceptions | ✅ **Fully covered.** The dashboard's Team Performance page (Page 2) shows SLA compliance BY assignment group (Container-Platform, Platform-Eng, Network-Ops, Data-Engineering, AppDev-Team, Identity-Security). The Owner Accountability Matrix assigns findings to specific individuals. The drill-through feature lets you click a team → see their specific findings → track closure. | `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (Page 2, L534-584), `Executive_Dashboard_Guide.md` (L548-581) |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ⏰ 8:30 AM — Morning Triage & Review

```
WHAT YOU DO:

1. OPEN Power BI Dashboard → Executive Risk Overview (Page 1)
   → Check Security Score (target: >75, critical if <40)
   → Check SLA Compliance % (target: >85%)
   → Note any NEW Critical findings (compare to yesterday)

2. CHECK Page 2 — SLA & Remediation Operations
   → Identify newly BREACHED tickets (SLA crossed 100%)
   → Identify AT-RISK tickets (SLA at 75-99% — about to breach)
   → Note which assignment_groups have breaches

3. CROSS-REFERENCE with Wiz Console
   → Open Wiz → Issues → filter CRITICAL + Open
   → Verify dashboard numbers match Wiz (data quality check)
   → Check attack paths for any new CRITICAL (graph context)

4. TRIAGE NEW FINDINGS
   → For each new CRITICAL/HIGH finding:
     a. Identify the resource in CMDB → who owns it?
     b. Check if ServiceNow ticket exists → if not, create one
     c. Determine priority: P1 (CRITICAL internet-facing),
        P2 (CRITICAL internal), P3 (HIGH), P4 (MEDIUM/LOW)
     d. Route to correct assignment_group based on CMDB owner
     e. Set SLA target based on severity:
        CRITICAL = 24 hours
        HIGH = 7 days
        MEDIUM = 30 days
        LOW = 90 days

TOOLS USED: Power BI, Wiz Console, ServiceNow, CMDB
TIME: ~45 minutes
```

### ⏰ 9:30 AM — ServiceNow Ticket Management

```
WHAT YOU DO:

1. REVIEW OPEN TICKETS in ServiceNow
   → Filter: Assignment Group = Cloud Security teams
   → Sort by: SLA breach date (soonest first)
   → For BREACHED tickets:
     a. Add work note: "SLA breached — escalating to manager"
     b. Update priority if needed
     c. Send escalation email to team lead

2. CMDB VALIDATION
   → For tickets with missing/wrong owner:
     a. Query CMDB by resource_id
     b. Verify owner, assignment_group, business_unit
     c. Update ticket routing if CMDB shows different owner
     d. Flag any CMDB gaps to the CMDB team

3. PROCESS CHANGE REQUESTS
   → For findings that need infrastructure changes:
     a. Create Change Request (CR) in ServiceNow
     b. Link CR to incident/finding ticket
     c. Add to change_request_id field
     d. Track through CAB approval process

4. BULK UPDATES (when needed)
   → Export ServiceNow data to CSV
   → Use Excel + VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH to reconcile
   → Identify bulk updates (e.g., reassign 20 tickets from
     disbanded team to new team)
   → Import updated CSV back to ServiceNow

TOOLS USED: ServiceNow, Excel (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP), CMDB
TIME: ~60 minutes
```

### ⏰ 10:30 AM — Deduplication & Correlation Analysis

```
WHAT YOU DO:

1. DEDUPLICATION CHECK
   → Export Wiz findings to CSV
   → Cross-reference with existing ServiceNow tickets
   → Identify duplicate findings (same resource + same rule)
   → Close duplicates in Wiz with note "Duplicate of WIZ-XXX"

2. CORRELATION ANALYSIS
   → Look for patterns:
     a. Same resource with multiple findings → "noisy resource"
     b. Same owner with multiple breaches → "overloaded owner"
     c. Same category trending up → "systemic gap"
   → Update Power BI dashboard recommendations (Page 3)

3. EXCEPTION MANAGEMENT
   → Review exception requests from teams
   → Validate: Is this a true exception or a lazy request?
   → If approved: Mark finding as "Exception" in Wiz
     Add expiry date and review cadence
   → If denied: Send explanation with remediation steps
   → Document all exceptions in exceptions tracker

TOOLS USED: Excel (PivotTables, conditional formatting), Wiz, Power BI
TIME: ~45 minutes
```

### ⏰ 11:30 AM — Azure & GCP Misconfiguration Review

   → Walk through each team's SLA compliance
   → Highlight breached/at-risk findings
   → Assign action items with deadlines

2. CLARIFY OWNERSHIP BOUNDARIES
   → For disputed resources (which team owns it?)
   → Cross-reference CMDB owner vs. Azure/GCP actual tag
   → Update CMDB if tags are more current
   → Email decision to both teams for record

3. TRACK REMEDIATION PROGRESS
   → Update ServiceNow tickets with latest status
   → If team says "fixed" → verify in Wiz (is finding resolved?)
   → If Wiz shows resolved → close ServiceNow ticket
   → If still open → send back to team with evidence

TOOLS USED: Power BI (screen share), ServiceNow, Teams/Outlook
TIME: ~90 minutes

> to CISO-level leadership.

### Version 2 — For Interview Self-Introduction (60 seconds)

> "In my current role, I manage end-to-end cloud security findings across Azure and GCP
> environments. My day starts with an automated pipeline I built — Python scripts pull
> data from the Wiz API, our SQL CMDB, and ServiceNow at 6 AM daily, and Power BI
> refreshes at 7 AM so the dashboard is fresh before I even sit down.
>
> I triage new findings by severity — CRITICALs get a 24-hour SLA with P1 tickets,
> HIGHs get 7 days — and I route them to the correct assignment group using CMDB ownership
> data. I track everything through ServiceNow, validate CMDB accuracy, and handle
> exceptions with documented expiry dates.
>
> On the analytics side, I built a 3-page Power BI dashboard with 20+ DAX measures —

> Matrix. I present this monthly to our CISO and run weekly office hours where app teams
> get remediation guidance.
>
> I also maintain the SOPs and remediation guides — per-category playbooks for network,
> IAM, storage, and container misconfigurations across both Azure and GCP."

### Version 3 — For Cover Letter Opening Paragraph

> I am a Cloud Security Analyst with a proven track record of building automated
> security reporting pipelines and managing findings remediation across multi-cloud
> environments. In my current role, I designed and maintain a Python-based ETL pipeline
> that connects Wiz CSPM/CWPP findings with ServiceNow SLA tracking and SQL CMDB
> ownership data, feeding a 3-page Power BI executive dashboard that reduced our SLA
> breach rate by enabling proactive escalation. I collaborate daily with SecOps, Platform
> Engineering, and Application teams to ensure accurate triage, timely remediation, and
> audit-ready compliance documentation.

---

# PART 5: INTERVIEW Q&A — Role-Specific

### Q1: "Walk me through how you manage security findings day-to-day."

> **A:** "My workflow starts before I arrive — I have an automated Python pipeline that
> runs at 6 AM, pulling findings from Wiz via GraphQL API, enriching them with CMDB
> ownership data from our SQL database, and pulling ServiceNow ticket status via REST API.
> All of this lands in a SQL warehouse, and Power BI does a scheduled refresh at 7 AM.
>
> When I sit down, I open the dashboard and immediately see the Security Score, open
> CRITICALs, and SLA compliance rate. If there's a new CRITICAL, I triage it immediately —
> I look up the resource in CMDB to find the owner, create a P1 ServiceNow ticket with a
> 24-hour SLA, and route it to the correct assignment group. For findings approaching SLA
> breach (75%+ of SLA consumed), I proactively escalate via email to the team lead.
>
> Through the day, I validate CMDB accuracy, process exception requests, run deduplication
> checks, and lead remediation meetings where I screen-share the dashboard to show teams
> their specific SLA performance. At the end of the week, I send a summary to the CISO."

### Q2: "How do you build and maintain your Power BI dashboards?"

> **A:** "I follow a structured approach. First, I design the data model — I have a fact
> table (wiz_findings) connected to two dimension tables (cmdb_assets and servicenow_tickets)
> via Many-to-One and One-to-One relationships. I also create a DAX date table for time
> intelligence.
>
> For the ETL layer, I use Power Query's M language to add calculated columns — things like
> `Age_Days` (how long a finding has been open), `SLA_Status` (Breached/At-Risk/On-Track),
> and `Severity_Order` (for proper sorting). Each transformation is a recorded step, so
> when the data refreshes, Power Query replays all steps automatically.

> For analytics, I use DAX measures — `CALCULATE` with multiple filter contexts for severity
> breakdowns, `AVERAGEX` with `FILTER` for MTTR calculations, `DATESMTD` and `DATEADD` for
> month-over-month trend analysis, and a custom `Security Score` formula that starts at 100
> and deducts points weighted by severity. I have 20+ measures in a dedicated Measures table.
>
> The dashboard has 3 pages: Executive Risk Overview for the CISO, SLA & Remediation
> Operations for weekly team meetings, and Posture Improvement for compliance tracking.
> I use conditional formatting (RAG colors), drill-through navigation, and slicers for
> cloud provider, severity, and category filtering."

### Q3: "How do you handle data quality issues — duplicates, missing owners, stale CMDB records?"

> **A:** "Data quality is one of my daily responsibilities. For deduplication, I export Wiz
> findings and cross-reference with ServiceNow tickets using Excel INDEX-MATCH on the
> `resource_id` field. If I find duplicate findings for the same resource and same rule,
> I close the duplicate in Wiz with a note referencing the original.
>
> For missing owners, my dashboard has an Owner Accountability Matrix on Page 3 — any
> finding without a CMDB owner shows up with 'Unassigned' in the matrix. I flag these
> weekly to the CMDB team for verification. When I find mismatches between CMDB owner and
> Azure/GCP resource tags, I update CMDB and email both the old and new owners.
>
> For stale CMDB records, I do a random sample of 20 assets every Wednesday — I check if
> the `cloud_resource_id` in CMDB actually exists in Azure/GCP. If the resource has been
> decommissioned but CMDB still shows it as Active, I submit a CMDB update request and
> verify it's processed. My pipeline only pulls Active assets, so once CMDB is updated,
> the dashboard automatically reflects the change on the next refresh."

### Q4: "Describe your experience with ServiceNow workflow management."

> **A:** "I use ServiceNow for the entire remediation lifecycle. When a new finding comes
> in from Wiz, I create an incident ticket with the correct priority (P1-P4 based on
> severity), route it to the assignment group based on CMDB ownership, and set the SLA
> target date based on our severity-specific SLA policy.
>
> I validate ticket routing by checking CMDB — if ServiceNow has a different assignment
> group than what CMDB shows, I correct it. For findings that require infrastructure
> changes, I create linked Change Requests (CRs) through the CAB process and track the
> `change_request_id` in the incident ticket.
>
> For bulk operations — like when a team reorganizes and 30 tickets need reassignment — I
> export from ServiceNow, use Excel XLOOKUP to map old assignment groups to new ones, and
> import the CSV back. My Power BI dashboard tracks all of this through SLA compliance
> metrics: if a team's SLA drops below 70%, it shows up red on the Team Performance page,
> and I escalate in our weekly remediation meeting."

### Q5: "How do you present security posture to leadership?"

> **A:** "I present a monthly executive dashboard to the CISO. The first page opens with
> the Security Score — a single 0-100 number that weights open findings by severity. Last
> month we were at 37, which I flagged as unacceptable for a financial institution.
>
> I walk through the trend — are we getting better or worse? I show Critical findings
> count, SLA compliance rate (we were at 48%, target is 85%+), and internet-facing
> exposure. Then I switch to the SLA page to highlight which teams are behind, and why.
>
> The third page has my improvement recommendations — I identify the top 5 actions that
> would have the highest impact on the Security Score. For example, 'Closing the 8 open
> CRITICALs would improve our score from 37 to 69.' This gives leadership concrete,
> measurable action items rather than vague statements.
>
> Everything is interactive — the CISO can click slicers to filter by Azure vs GCP,
> or drill-through from a team's bar chart to see their specific findings. I export a
> PDF snapshot for the board report and share the live dashboard link with the CISO's
> direct reports."
