## 15. TA0011 — Command and Control (C2)

#### Overview
After establishing a foothold, adversaries need a **communication channel** back to their infrastructure to issue commands, receive output, and download additional tools. C2 is the adversary's lifeline — **cutting C2 = cutting the attacker off**.

#### Key Techniques

| Technique ID | Technique | Description | Detection Source |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| T1071.001 | Application Layer Protocol: Web (HTTP/S) | C2 over HTTP/HTTPS | Proxy logs, SSL inspection |
| T1071.004 | DNS | C2 encoded in DNS queries | DNS logs, passive DNS |
| T1573 | Encrypted Channel | Custom encryption for C2 | Network anomaly, JA3/JA3S |
| T1572 | Protocol Tunneling | Tunnel C2 inside SSH, DNS, ICMP | Deep packet inspection, anomaly |
| T1090.002 | External Proxy | Route C2 through proxies/CDNs | Proxy logs, domain fronting |
| T1105 | Ingress Tool Transfer | Download additional tools via C2 | Proxy, EDR, Sysmon 11 |
| T1571 | Non-Standard Port | C2 on unusual port (443 on HTTP) | Firewall, network anomaly |
| T1568.002 | Dynamic Resolution: DGA | Domain Generation Algorithms | DNS logs, entropy analysis |
| T1102 | Web Service | Use legitimate services (GitHub, Slack, Telegram) for C2 | Proxy, EDR |
| T1132 | Data Encoding | Base64/custom encoding in traffic | Network inspection |

#### 🔍 Hunting Queries & What to Look For

| Hunt | Data Source | What to Search |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Beaconing | Proxy/Firewall | Regular interval connections (every 60s ± jitter) to same domain/IP |
| DNS tunneling | DNS logs | High volume of TXT/NULL queries, long subdomain labels (>50 chars), high entropy |
| DGA domains | DNS logs | Algorithmically generated domains (high entropy, random characters) |
| Unusual User-Agents | Proxy logs | Non-browser HTTP traffic, custom user-agents, missing standard headers |
| Long DNS queries | DNS logs | Subdomain length > 50 characters (data in subdomain = exfil/C2) |
| JA3 fingerprints | Network sensor | Known malicious JA3 hashes (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Sliver) |
| Domain fronting | Proxy/TLS | SNI hostname differs from HTTP Host header |
| C2 via legitimate services | Proxy | Repeated API calls to pastebin, github raw, telegram bots, discord webhooks |

#### ✅ True Positive Scenario — HTTPS Beaconing (T1071.001 + T1573)

**Scenario:** Network anomaly detection identifies a workstation making HTTPS connections to `cdn-static-assets[.]com` every 62-68 seconds for 14 hours. The domain was registered 5 days ago and resolves to a VPS provider.

**Investigation Steps:**
```
1. CONFIRM BEACONING PATTERN
   □ Regular interval (62-68s) = consistent with C2 jitter → 🔴
   □ 14 hours of sustained beaconing = persistent implant
   □ HTTPS on port 443 → encrypted C2 channel
   □ New domain (5 days old) on VPS → throwaway infrastructure

2. DOMAIN/IP ANALYSIS
   □ WHOIS: registration date, registrar, privacy protection
   □ Passive DNS: what other IPs has this domain resolved to?
   □ VirusTotal: any malware samples communicating with this domain?
   □ URLScan.io: what does the website look like?
   □ JA3/JA3S hash: matches known C2 framework? (Cobalt Strike JA3)

3. ENDPOINT INVESTIGATION
   □ What process is making the connections? (Sysmon Event 3)
   □ Is it a legitimate process (svchost, explorer) or malicious binary?
   □ If legitimate process → possible process injection (check Sysmon 8)
   □ Check for parent process and full execution chain
   □ Check for persistence mechanism keeping the beacon alive

4. TLS/SSL INSPECTION
   □ If SSL inspection is available: inspect traffic content
   □ Check for unusual certificate properties (self-signed, short validity)
   □ Check certificate issuer and subject name
   □ Small POST requests (command check-in) → larger responses (commands)

5. RESPOND
   □ Block the domain and IP at firewall/proxy immediately
   □ DO NOT alert the user first — isolate endpoint silently
   □ Capture memory dump of the beaconing process
   □ Isolate the endpoint from the network
   □ Identify the malware/implant type (Cobalt Strike? Custom?)
   □ Search for same domain/IP/JA3 across all endpoints
   □ Check for lateral movement from this host
   □ Full forensic investigation
   □ Add IOCs to threat intel platform
```

**TP Confidence:** 🔴 CRITICAL — Regular beacon interval to new domain on VPS = confirmed C2 communication.

#### ✅ True Positive Scenario — DNS Tunneling C2 (T1071.004)

**Scenario:** DNS monitoring reveals a workstation sending 500+ DNS TXT queries per hour to subdomains of `update-check[.]xyz`. Subdomain labels are 60+ character Base64-encoded strings like: `dGhpcyBpcyBlbmNvZGVkIGRhdGE.update-check[.]xyz`

**Investigation Steps:**
```
1. CONFIRM DNS TUNNELING
   □ 500+ queries/hour to single domain → abnormal → 🔴
   □ Long subdomain labels (60+ chars) with Base64 encoding → DATA IN DNS
   □ TXT record queries → response carries C2 commands
   □ This is textbook DNS tunneling (dnscat2, iodine, Cobalt Strike DNS)

2. DECODE THE DATA
   □ Base64 decode subdomain labels → what data is being sent?
   □ Is it command output? Credential data? File contents?
   □ Check TXT responses → are C2 commands embedded?

3. ENDPOINT INVESTIGATION
   □ What process is generating DNS queries? (Sysmon Event 22 or Event 3)
   □ Is it a known DNS tunneling tool or custom implant?
   □ Check process tree and persistence
   □ When did the tunneling start? (first query timestamp)

4. NETWORK SCOPE
   □ Are other hosts querying the same domain?
   □ Does your DNS server forward to upstream? (queries visible there too)
   □ Calculate total data volume transferred via DNS

5. RESPOND
   □ Block the domain at DNS resolver (sinkhole to internal server)
   □ Isolate the endpoint
   □ Capture the DNS tunneling tool for analysis
   □ Create DNS analytics: flag domains with high query volume + long labels
   □ Consider DNS query length restrictions at resolver
   □ Deploy DNS security solution (DNS firewall/RPZ)
```

**TP Confidence:** 🔴 CRITICAL — High-volume encoded DNS queries to single domain = confirmed DNS tunneling C2.

## 16. TA0010 — Exfiltration

#### Overview
The adversary's **end goal** — stealing data out of the organization. Exfiltration can use the C2 channel, alternative protocols, or physical media.

#### Key Techniques

| Technique ID | Technique | Description | Detection Source |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| T1041 | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel | Use existing C2 to extract data | C2 detection + data volume |
| T1048 | Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol | FTP, SFTP, DNS, SMTP | Network logs, DLP |
| T1567 | Exfiltration to Cloud Storage | Upload to Dropbox, OneDrive, Mega | Proxy, CASB, DLP |
| T1029 | Scheduled Transfer | Timed data transfers | Network anomaly, schedule |
| T1030 | Data Transfer Size Limits | Small chunks to avoid detection | Network anomaly |
| T1052 | Exfiltration Over Physical Medium | USB, portable drives | USB audit logs, DLP |
| T1537 | Transfer Data to Cloud Account | Upload to attacker's cloud | Cloud audit logs |

#### 🔍 Hunting Queries & What to Look For

| Hunt | Data Source | What to Search |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Large outbound transfers | Firewall/Proxy | Uploads > 100MB to external IPs/domains, especially after-hours |
| Cloud storage uploads | Proxy/CASB | Bulk uploads to personal Dropbox, Google Drive, Mega.nz |
| DNS exfiltration | DNS logs | Encoded data in subdomain labels (same as DNS C2) |
| Email exfiltration | Email gateway | Emails with large/numerous attachments to personal addresses |
| USB data copy | USB audit/DLP | Large file copies to removable media |
| Encrypted uploads | Proxy | Large HTTPS POSTs to unknown/new domains |
| Scheduled FTP | Firewall | Recurring FTP/SFTP connections to external at same time |

#### ✅ True Positive Scenario — Exfiltration to Cloud Storage (T1567)

**Scenario:** CASB alerts that user `s.contractor` uploaded 4.2 GB of data to a personal Mega.nz account during 1 AM - 3 AM. The data consists of 340 files from the Engineering share.

**Investigation Steps:**
```
1. CONFIRM ABNORMAL UPLOAD
   □ 4.2 GB upload to personal cloud storage → 🔴
   □ Mega.nz = encrypted cloud, popular for exfil
   □ 1-3 AM = outside business hours → suspicious timing
   □ Contractor account accessing Engineering data → policy violation at minimum

2. ANALYZE THE DATA
   □ What 340 files were uploaded? (DLP/CASB file listing)
   □ Classification: PII, trade secrets, source code, financial?
   □ Were files downloaded from Engineering share first? (Event 5145)
   □ Were files staged/archived before upload?

3. INVESTIGATE THE ACCOUNT
   □ Is s.contractor still an active contractor?
   □ Is this their typical work pattern?
   □ Check login history: was the account compromised?
   □ Check for impossible travel or unusual login source
   □ Interview the contractor (via HR/Legal)

4. DETERMINE INTENT: INSIDER THREAT vs. EXTERNAL COMPROMISE
   □ If contractor's account was hacked → external actor using their access
   □ If contractor intentionally exfiltrated → insider threat
   □ Check if contractor gave notice recently or has grievances
   □ Check for other data hoarding behavior in recent weeks

5. RESPOND
   □ Disable the contractor's account immediately
   □ Block Mega.nz at proxy (or at least personal accounts)
   □ Notify Legal, HR, and CISO about potential data breach
   □ Preserve all audit logs as evidence
   □ Request Mega.nz account takedown (through legal channels)
   □ Assess regulatory impact (GDPR, CCPA, export controls)
   □ Initiate incident response for data breach
   □ Review all contractor access permissions
```

**TP Confidence:** 🔴 CRITICAL — 4.2 GB upload to personal cloud at 1 AM by contractor = confirmed data exfiltration.

## 17. TA0040 — Impact

#### Overview
Adversaries may **destroy, encrypt, or disrupt** systems and data. This includes ransomware, data wiping, defacement, and denial of service. Impact is the **most visible** tactic — it's when the attack reaches its destructive conclusion.

#### Key Techniques

| Technique ID | Technique | Description | Detection Source |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact | Ransomware encryption | EDR, File integrity |
| T1485 | Data Destruction | Delete/overwrite data | EDR, File integrity |
| T1490 | Inhibit System Recovery | Delete shadow copies, backups | Event 4688 (vssadmin, wbadmin) |
| T1489 | Service Stop | Stop critical services | Event 7036 |
| T1491 | Defacement | Modify web content | File integrity, Web monitoring |
| T1561 | Disk Wipe | Wipe MBR or disk content | EDR, Boot sector monitoring |
| T1529 | System Shutdown/Reboot | Force reboot after encryption | Event 1074 |
| T1498 | Network Denial of Service | DDoS attacks | Network monitoring |

#### ✅ True Positive Scenario — Ransomware Pre-Deployment (T1486 + T1490)

**Scenario:** Multiple servers simultaneously execute:
```
vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet
wmic shadowcopy delete
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No
wbadmin delete catalog -quiet
```
Followed by a new executable `svc_update.exe` dropping ransom notes named `RECOVER-FILES.txt` in multiple directories.

**Investigation Steps:**
```
1. IMMEDIATE — THIS IS AN ACTIVE RANSOMWARE ATTACK
   □ Shadow copy deletion + recovery disabled = pre-encryption → 🔴 CRITICAL
   □ Ransom note deployment = ACTIVE RANSOMWARE
   □ Time is critical — every second, more files encrypt
   □ ACTIVATE INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN IMMEDIATELY

2. CONTAIN — FIRST PRIORITY (Minutes matter)
   □ Isolate ALL affected servers from network immediately
   □ Disable the account executing the ransomware
   □ Block the ransomware hash at EDR (auto-quarantine)
   □ Disconnect network segments to prevent spread
   □ Shut down shares (SMB) to prevent lateral encryption
   □ DO NOT shut down encrypted servers (memory forensics possible)

3. SCOPE THE ATTACK
   □ How many servers are affected?
   □ What data has been encrypted? Is it recoverable from backup?
   □ Are backups intact? (attackers often target backups first)
   □ Has the ransomware spread to workstations?
   □ Are domain controllers compromised?

4. INVESTIGATE THE KILL CHAIN
   □ How did the attacker get in? (Initial Access — check past days/weeks)
   □ How long has the attacker been in the environment? (dwell time)
   □ What credentials were compromised?
   □ What persistence was established? (must be removed before recovery)
   □ Was data exfiltrated BEFORE encryption? (double extortion)

5. RESPOND & RECOVER
   □ Engage executive leadership and legal counsel
   □ Contact cyber insurance provider
   □ Engage incident response firm (if needed)
   □ Determine ransom demand and payment policy
   □ Identify ransomware variant (ID Ransomware, check for decryptors)
   □ Begin restoration from clean backups (verify integrity first)
   □ Rebuild compromised systems from clean images
   □ Reset ALL passwords (assume complete credential compromise)
   □ Reset KRBTGT password (twice, 12-hour interval)
   □ Implement all missing security controls before reconnecting
   □ Post-incident: complete lessons learned review
```

**TP Confidence:** 🔴 CRITICAL — Shadow copy deletion + ransom notes = ACTIVE RANSOMWARE ATTACK. Maximum severity.
