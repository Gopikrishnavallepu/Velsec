# Cisco SOC Security Investigator – Interview Q&A
## Part 4: Scenario-Based Questions & Behavioral Questions

---

## Section J: Scenario-Based Investigation Questions

---

### Q40. Scenario: You receive an alert that a user's workstation is communicating with a known C2 server. Walk through your investigation.

**Answer:**

**Step 1: Validate the alert (2 min)**
- Confirm the C2 IP/domain against multiple TI sources (Cisco Talos, VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).
- Check if this is an authorized pen test or red team exercise.
- Verify the alert isn't triggered by a security researcher visiting a threat intel page that contains the C2 domain.

**Step 2: Assess urgency and scope (3 min)**
- Identify the affected host: hostname, user, department, asset criticality.
- Check if the connection is **active or historical**.
- Look for multiple internal hosts communicating with the same C2 → indicates broader compromise.

**Step 3: Containment decision (5 min)**
- If active C2 communication is confirmed → **isolate the endpoint via EDR immediately** while maintaining agent connectivity.
- Disable the user's AD account to prevent credential reuse.
- Block the C2 IP/domain at the firewall and proxy for the entire environment.

**Step 4: Deep investigation (30-60 min)**
- **EDR analysis**: What process is making the connection? Trace the process tree back to the initial infection vector.
- **Network logs**: How long has the communication been occurring? What's the volume and frequency? Is data being exfiltrated?
- **Email logs**: Did the user receive a phishing email prior to the first C2 connection?
- **DNS logs**: Look for DNS queries to the C2 domain from other hosts.
- **Authentication logs**: Has the compromised user account been used to access other systems since the compromise?

**Step 5: Scope expansion**
- Search the entire environment for the same IOCs (file hashes, C2 domain, attacker tools).
- Check for lateral movement indicators from the compromised host.

**Step 6: Remediate and communicate**
- Provide client with detailed findings: timeline, impact, IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
- Recommend: reimage endpoint, reset all credentials used on the host, monitor for attacker re-entry, patch the vulnerability exploited for initial access.

### Q41. Scenario: A client reports they suspect data exfiltration. How do you investigate?

**Answer:**

**Phase 1: Scoping Questions to Client**
- When did you first suspect? What triggered the suspicion?
- Which data do you believe was exfiltrated? What systems store it?
- Any recent employee terminations, departures, or policy violations?
- Any known security incidents prior to this?

**Phase 2: Network Analysis**
- Review **NetFlow/proxy logs** for unusual outbound data volumes from critical data servers.
- Look for large transfers to external IPs, cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive, Mega), or personal email services.
- Check for **DNS-based exfiltration** — unusually large or frequent DNS queries to external domains.
- Check for **ICMP tunneling** — suspiciously large ICMP packets.
- Look for traffic on unusual ports (high numbered, non-standard protocols).

**Phase 3: Endpoint Analysis**
- **EDR**: Check for data staging behaviors — files being compressed/archived (zip/rar/7z) before transfer.
- Look for USB storage device connections (Event ID 6416 or EDR USB logs).
- Check for screenshot tools, keyloggers, or data collection utilities.
- Review clipboard history if available.

**Phase 4: Identity & Access Analysis**
- Review access logs on the suspected data repository — who accessed what files, when, and how much.
- Check for privilege escalation — did anyone gain unauthorized access to the data?
- Review VPN logs — was there unusual remote access (off-hours, unusual geo-IP)?

**Phase 5: Email & Cloud Analysis**
- Check email gateway for large attachments sent to personal addresses.
- Review DLP (Data Loss Prevention) alerts — were there any that were suppressed or overridden?
- Check cloud app (O365/Google Workspace) audit logs for unusual sharing or download activity.

**Phase 6: Findings & Recommendations**
- Deliver timeline of suspicious activity with evidence.
- Recommend: implement/enhance DLP, restrict USB usage, monitor high-risk users, review data classification and access controls.

### Q42. Scenario: Multiple hosts in the environment are showing signs of ransomware activity. What do you do?

**Answer:**

**This is a P1 incident — time is critical.**

**Immediate Actions (First 15 minutes)**:
1. **Contain**: Network-isolate all confirmed and suspected infected hosts via EDR. If EDR isn't available, pull network cables or disable switch ports.
2. **Block lateral movement**: Disable SMB (port 445) and RDP (port 3389) across the environment via firewall rules if possible.
3. **Disable compromised accounts**: If you can identify the account used for propagation, disable it immediately.
4. **Preserve evidence**: Do NOT reboot infected machines — volatile memory contains encryption keys, process information, and attacker artifacts.
5. **Communicate**: Escalate to client IR team, Cisco MSS management, and potentially Cisco Talos IR (CTIR).

**Investigation (Parallel to containment)**:
1. **Identify the ransomware variant**: Check ransom note filename, encrypted file extension, file hash — compare against known ransomware families (ID Ransomware, No More Ransom Project).
2. **Determine scope**: How many hosts are affected? Which file shares are encrypted? Is the domain controller compromised?
3. **Find patient zero**: Work backward from the first encrypted file timestamp. Check email logs, VPN logs, RDP exposure, and recent vulnerability exploitation.
4. **Identify propagation method**: Is it self-propagating (WannaCry/NotPetya style) or manually deployed post-compromise? Check for PsExec, WMI, Group Policy deployment.
5. **Check backups**: Are backups intact? Were backup systems also encrypted (common tactic)?

**Recovery Guidance**:
- Do NOT pay ransom without legal/executive/law enforcement consultation.
- Check if a decryption tool exists for this variant (nomoreransom.org).
- Rebuild from clean backups after eradicating the threat.
- Reset ALL credentials enterprise-wide (assume full compromise).
- Patch the entry point vulnerability before reconnecting.

### Q43. Scenario: You notice suspicious PowerShell activity on a server. How do you analyze it?

**Answer:**

**Step 1: Examine the PowerShell logs**
- **Event ID 4104** (Script Block Logging): Shows the actual PowerShell code executed, even if encoded/obfuscated.
- **Event ID 4103** (Module Logging): Shows cmdlet invocations and parameters.
- **Event ID 400/800** (Engine Lifecycle): PowerShell engine start/stop.

**Step 2: Key suspicious indicators**
- `-EncodedCommand` / `-e` / `-ec` — Base64-encoded commands (evasion technique).
- `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` — Bypassing script execution restriction.
- `-NoProfile -NonInteractive -WindowStyle Hidden` — Running silently.
- `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) — Executing dynamically constructed code.
- `Net.WebClient`, `DownloadString`, `DownloadFile` — Downloading from external sources.
- `Invoke-Mimikatz`, `Invoke-Kerberoast` — Known attack tools.
- `[System.Convert]::FromBase64String` — Decoding embedded payloads.
- AMSI bypass strings — Attempting to disable Antimalware Scan Interface.

**Step 3: Decode and analyze**
- If Base64-encoded: `echo "<base64>" | base64 -d` or PowerShell `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String("<base64>"))`.
- Analyze the decoded script: What does it do? Where does it connect? What data does it access?

**Step 4: Process context**
- What user account ran this PowerShell?
- What parent process launched PowerShell? (If `explorer.exe` → user-initiated; if `winword.exe` → macro execution; if `w3wp.exe` → web shell).
- Was this expected admin activity on this server?

**Step 5: Network context**
- Did the PowerShell session make any external connections?
- Was a payload downloaded?
- Was data exfiltrated?

### Q44. Scenario: A client asks you to explain a security incident to their executive leadership (non-technical audience). How do you approach this?

**Answer:**

**Key principle**: Translate technical details into business impact and risk.

**Structure my communication**:

1. **What happened** (one sentence):
   "An employee's computer was compromised through a phishing email, allowing an attacker to access our internal network for approximately 48 hours."

2. **What's the impact** (business terms):
   "The attacker accessed the Finance shared drive. We examined the access logs and found 230 files were opened, including Q3 financial projections. No evidence of data being transferred outside the network, but we cannot guarantee it wasn't viewed or copied."

3. **What we did**:
   "We identified and isolated the affected computer within 30 minutes of detection, reset all compromised credentials, blocked the attacker's infrastructure, and scanned the environment for any additional compromise."

4. **What you should do now**:
   - "Notify your legal team to assess potential regulatory obligations."
   - "Brief the Finance team on what was accessed."
   - "We recommend company-wide password resets and enhanced email security controls."

5. **How we prevent recurrence**:
   - "Implement advanced email filtering to catch similar phishing attempts."
   - "Deploy multi-factor authentication for remote access."
   - "Conduct targeted security awareness training for employees."

**What I avoid**: Jargon (C2, lateral movement, LOLBins), blame (never say "your employee clicked a link"), and excessive technical detail. Executives need to make decisions — give them the information needed for that.

### Q45. Scenario: You discover a zero-day vulnerability being exploited in a client's environment. What do you do?

**Answer:**

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Verify**: Confirm it's a true zero-day (no patch available) vs. an unpatched known vulnerability.
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems. Implement compensating controls — WAF virtual patching, network segmentation, disable the vulnerable feature/service if possible.
3. **Scope**: Determine how many systems are vulnerable and how many show signs of exploitation.
4. **Document**: Capture all evidence — exploit artifacts, network traffic, affected systems, timeline.

**Escalation**:
1. **Client**: Immediate notification per SLA — this is a critical/P1 event.
2. **Cisco Talos**: Report the zero-day for analysis, signature development, and responsible disclosure.
3. **Vendor**: Contact the software vendor with details for patch development.
4. **Information sharing**: Share IOCs with trusted communities (ISAC, MISP) without revealing client identity.

**Ongoing**:
1. **Monitor**: Implement custom detection rules for the exploitation pattern (even without a signature, the exploit behavior may be detectable).
2. **Hunt**: Search for evidence of exploitation across all clients running the same software.
3. **Track**: Monitor vendor advisory channels for patch release.
4. **Patch**: When patch is available, coordinate emergency patching with client.

### Q47. Describe a time when you had to handle a high-pressure security incident.

**Answer (STAR Format):**

**Situation**: During a weekend shift, multiple alerts fired simultaneously across three different client environments — a widespread phishing campaign delivering Emotet was hitting our managed clients.

**Task**: As the primary investigator on shift, I needed to triage all three environments, contain the threat, and communicate with each client — while two other lower-priority alerts were also in the queue.

**Action**:
1. **Prioritized**: Assessed which client had the most confirmed infections (Client B had 8 hosts with active C2) vs. alerts only (Client A and C had 2-3 each).
2. **Parallel containment**: Used EDR to bulk-isolate confirmed infected hosts across all three clients simultaneously.
3. **Communicated**: Sent initial notifications to all three clients within SLA, with clear "what we know and what we're doing" summaries.
4. **Delegated**: Requested on-call backup analyst assistance. Assigned Client A and C to them after providing initial findings and IOC list.
5. **Deep investigation on Client B**: Traced the Emotet delivery chain, identified the phishing email campaign, and discovered 3 additional compromised hosts that hadn't yet triggered alerts (found via C2 domain hunting in proxy logs).
6. **Bulk remediation**: Worked with clients to purge phishing emails from all mailboxes, reset affected credentials, and add IOCs to blocklists.

**Result**: All three incidents were contained within 2 hours. Client B (most impacted) had full remediation within 6 hours. No data exfiltration occurred. Detected 3 additional infections that automated alerts missed. Wrote a cross-client advisory shared to all MSS clients about the campaign.

### Q48. How do you handle a disagreement with a colleague about the classification of a security event?

**Answer:**

1. **Focus on evidence, not opinions**: "Let's look at what the data shows" — pull up the actual logs, EDR telemetry, and TI enrichment results.

2. **Understand their perspective**: Maybe they're seeing something I missed, or they have context about the client's environment that changes the classification.

3. **Use a structured framework**: Apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework or the investigation playbook — does the evidence map to a known technique? Does it meet the criteria for a True Positive per our SOPs?

4. **Escalate constructively if needed**: If we can't agree, bring in a senior analyst or team lead to review the evidence together. This isn't about "winning" — it's about getting the right answer for the client.

5. **Document the rationale**: Whatever the final decision, document why the event was classified that way. This helps future analysts and improves our playbooks.

**Key mindset**: In a SOC, false negatives can lead to breaches and false positives erode client trust. Both classification errors have consequences, so healthy debate is encouraged — as long as it's evidence-based and time-bounded.

### Q49. What motivates you to work in a SOC / cybersecurity operations?

**Answer:**

"What drives me is the fact that this work has real impact. Every alert I investigate, every threat I catch, every remediation recommendation I provide — there's a real organization and real people on the other end who are depending on us to protect them.

I find the investigative work genuinely fascinating — piecing together an attack chain from fragmented evidence across multiple log sources is like solving a complex puzzle where the adversary is actively trying to hide the pieces.

The constant evolution of the threat landscape means I'm always learning. No two days are the same, and the knowledge I gained last month directly helps me catch something new this month. That continuous learning loop is addictive.

And specifically about managed security services — I enjoy the challenge of protecting multiple diverse environments simultaneously. Each client is different, each environment has unique architectures and risk profiles, and that breadth of exposure accelerates my growth as a security professional."

### Q50. Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years in cybersecurity?

**Answer:**

"In the near term, I want to deepen my technical expertise as a Security Investigator — master advanced forensics, malware analysis, and threat hunting methodologies. I'm planning to pursue the GCIH and OSCP certifications within the next 18 months.

In 3-5 years, I see myself moving into a senior or lead role where I can combine hands-on investigation with mentoring junior analysts, developing detection strategies, and driving process improvements for the team. I'm also interested in contributing to detection engineering — building and tuning the rules and analytics that make the SOC more effective.

Long-term, I'm drawn to threat intelligence and adversary tracking — understanding the 'who' and 'why' behind attacks, not just the 'what' and 'how.' Cisco's Talos organization is an aspirational team for that kind of work.

My goal is to continuously move up the pyramid of pain — from reacting to IOCs to understanding and disrupting adversary TTPs."

## Section L: Cisco-Specific & Managed Security Services Questions

---

### Q51. Why Cisco and specifically Cisco Managed Security Services?

**Answer:**

"Three reasons:

1. **Talos advantage**: Cisco Talos is one of the largest threat intelligence organizations in the world. As a Cisco MSS investigator, I'd have direct access to Talos intelligence, research, and detection content. That's a massive force multiplier compared to working with a smaller MSSP.

2. **Technology breadth**: Cisco's security portfolio — Secure Endpoint, Firepower, Umbrella, Secure Network Analytics, XDR, Duo — gives me exposure to a comprehensive security stack. Investigating across these integrated products means better visibility and faster investigations.

3. **Scale and impact**: Cisco MSS protects thousands of organizations globally across every industry vertical. That means I'd be exposed to a massive variety of attack types, environments, and adversaries — which accelerates my growth and lets me make a bigger impact."

### Q52. How do you handle client-facing communication during security incidents?

**Answer:**

**Principles**:
1. **Timeliness**: Notify within SLA (P1 = immediate, P2 = within X hours per contract). Don't wait until you have all the answers — provide what you know and set expectations for updates.

2. **Clarity**: Use clear, jargon-free language. Structure updates as: What happened → What we've done → What we recommend → Next update timeline.

3. **Calibrated confidence**: Be honest about certainty levels. "We've confirmed that..." vs. "We believe based on current evidence that..." vs. "We're still investigating whether..."

4. **Actionable**: Every communication should tell the client what they need to do (or explicitly confirm they don't need to do anything yet).

5. **Empathy**: The client is stressed during an incident. Acknowledge their concern and reassure them you're actively working on it.

**Example update format**:
> **Incident Update — [Timestamp UTC]**
> **Status**: Active Investigation
> **Summary**: We've confirmed compromise of host WORKSTATION-042 via a phishing email received at 14:32 UTC. The host has been isolated.
> **Current Actions**: Investigating potential lateral movement to 2 additional hosts.
> **Client Action Required**: Please confirm whether user jsmith@client.com had access to any regulated data repositories.
> **Next Update**: By 18:00 UTC or sooner if material findings occur.
