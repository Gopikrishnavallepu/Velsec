# 🔍 SOC Detection Checklist — TP or FP?

> **Purpose**: A step-by-step checklist to determine if a detection/alert is a **True Positive (TP)** or **False Positive (FP)**.  
> **How to use**: When an alert fires → go to the matching section → follow the checklist → make your decision.

## Quick Recall: What Are We Deciding?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## 🧭 Universal First-Response Checklist (Do This EVERY Time)

Before diving into specific detection types, run through these **5 universal checks**:

- [ ] **1. READ the alert details** — Source, severity, timestamp, affected asset, triggered rule name
- [ ] **2. CHECK the user/source** — Is this a known user? Known system? Service account?
- [ ] **3. CHECK the timing** — Did this happen during business hours or off-hours?
- [ ] **4. CHECK history** — Has this alert fired before for this user/system? Was it TP or FP last time?
- [ ] **5. CHECK threat intel** — Are any IPs, domains, or hashes flagged in VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, or your TI feeds?

> Once done, move to the **specific checklist** below based on your alert type.

## 1. 🔐 Brute Force Detection

**Alert Trigger**: Multiple failed login attempts (Event ID **4625**) in a short period

### Step-by-Step Checklist

| # | Check | How to Verify | TP Signal 🔴 | FP Signal 🟢 |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Source IP** | Check the IP in SIEM — is it internal or external? | External / unknown IP | Internal / known VPN IP |
| 2 | **Number of failures** | Count failed attempts in time window | 10+ failures in < 5 min | 2-3 failures (user typo) |
| 3 | **Target accounts** | One account or many? | Multiple accounts targeted | Single account (user forgot password) |
| 4 | **Success after failures?** | Check for Event ID **4624** after the 4625s | ✅ Yes → Compromised! (TP) | No success → attack failed |
| 5 | **Time of activity** | Business hours or off-hours? | 3 AM on a weekend | 9 AM on Monday |
| 6 | **Geo-location** | Where is the source IP from? | Foreign country, unusual location | User's normal location |
| 7 | **Contact the user** | Call/message the user directly | "I didn't try to log in" | "Yes, I forgot my password" |

### Decision Flow

```
Multiple 4625 events?
  ├── YES
  │   ├── From external/unknown IP?
  │   │   ├── YES → Followed by 4624 (success)?
  │   │   │   ├── YES → 🔴 TP — Account Compromised! → Disable account, block IP
  │   │   │   └── NO  → 🟡 TP (Attack attempted, not successful) → Block IP, monitor
  │   │   └── NO (internal IP)
  │   │       ├── User confirms activity? → 🟢 FP — Password issue
  │   │       └── User denies activity?   → 🔴 TP — Internal threat
  └── NO → 🟢 FP — Normal failed login
```

### Logs to Check
- [ ] Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4625, 4624, 4740)
- [ ] Active Directory logs
- [ ] VPN / Remote Access logs
- [ ] SIEM correlation rules

## 2. 📧 Phishing Email Detection

**Alert Trigger**: Suspicious email reported by user or caught by email security gateway

### Step-by-Step Checklist

| # | Check | How to Verify | TP Signal 🔴 | FP Signal 🟢 |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Sender address** | Inspect the "From" field carefully | Misspelled domain (e.g., `@paypa1.com`) | Exact match to legitimate domain |
| 2 | **SPF check** | View email headers → look for SPF result | `SPF: FAIL` | `SPF: PASS` |
| 3 | **DKIM check** | View email headers → look for DKIM result | `DKIM: FAIL` | `DKIM: PASS` |
| 4 | **DMARC check** | View email headers → look for DMARC result | `DMARC: FAIL` | `DMARC: PASS` |
| 5 | **Reply-to address** | Compare reply-to with sender | Different from sender address | Same as sender or not present |
| 6 | **URLs in body** | Hover over / extract all URLs | URL domain ≠ display text, uses URL shortener | Legitimate known URL |
| 7 | **URL reputation** | Check URLs in VirusTotal / URLhaus | Flagged as malicious | Clean reputation |
| 8 | **Attachments** | Check file type and hash | `.exe`, `.js`, `.scr`, `.bat`, macro-enabled `.docm` | `.pdf`, `.png` from known sender |
| 9 | **Attachment hash** | Get MD5/SHA256 → check VirusTotal | Hash flagged by multiple AV engines | Clean / 0 detections |
| 10 | **Email content** | Read the body text | Urgency, threats, "click now", grammar errors | Normal business communication |
| 11 | **Who else received?** | Search SIEM for same subject/sender | Sent to many users (campaign) | Only this recipient |
| 12 | **Did user click?** | Check proxy/web logs for URL visit | User visited the malicious URL | No click recorded |

### Decision Flow

```
Suspicious email alert?
  ├── Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC
  │   ├── ALL PASS + Legitimate domain → 🟢 Likely FP
  │   └── ANY FAIL or spoofed domain
  │       ├── Contains malicious URL/attachment?
  │       │   ├── YES
  │       │   │   ├── User clicked/opened?
  │       │   │   │   ├── YES → 🔴 TP — URGENT! → Isolate endpoint, reset creds
  │       │   │   │   └── NO  → 🔴 TP — Blocked → Block sender, purge from mailboxes
  │       │   └── NO → 🟡 Suspicious but not directly malicious → Monitor, block sender
  └── Legitimate email miscategorized → 🟢 FP → Whitelist sender
```

### Artifacts to Collect
- [ ] Sender email address
- [ ] Sender IP address
- [ ] Email subject line
- [ ] Recipient email addresses (all)
- [ ] Reply-to email address
- [ ] Date/time
- [ ] All URLs (expanded if shortened)

- [ ] DNS logs (did endpoint resolve the malicious domain?)
- [ ] Firewall logs (outbound connection to malicious IP?)

## 3. 💀 Ransomware Detection

**Alert Trigger**: AV/EDR alert for ransomware, files encrypted, ransom note displayed

### Step-by-Step Checklist

| # | Check | How to Verify | TP Signal 🔴 | FP Signal 🟢 |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **AV/EDR alert** | Review the alert details and signature name | Known ransomware family detected | Generic / heuristic low-confidence alert |
| 2 | **File activity** | Check for mass file renames/encryption | Many files with new extensions (`.encrypted`, `.locked`) | Normal file operations |
| 3 | **Ransom note** | Look for ransom note files on disk | `README.txt`, `HOW_TO_DECRYPT.html` found | No ransom artifacts |
| 4 | **Process activity** | Check EDR for suspicious processes | Unknown process encrypting files rapidly | Known backup / encryption tool |
| 5 | **Network connections** | Check for C2 communication | Outbound connections to suspicious IPs | No unusual connections |
| 6 | **User confirmation** | Contact the endpoint user | "My files are locked, I see a ransom message" | "I was running a legitimate encryption tool" |
| 7 | **Lateral spread** | Check other endpoints for similar activity | Same behavior on multiple machines | Isolated to one machine |

### Decision Flow

```
AV/EDR ransomware alert?
  ├── Files actually encrypted + ransom note present?
  │   ├── YES → 🔴 TP — CRITICAL!
  │   │         → Isolate machine immediately
  │   │         → Check for lateral spread
  │   │         → Activate IR playbook
  │   └── NO
  │       ├── Process known/legitimate? (e.g., BitLocker, backup tool)
  │       │   ├── YES → 🟢 FP — Legitimate encryption activity
  │       │   └── NO  → 🟡 Suspicious — Investigate further, sandbox the file
  └── Heuristic-only detection, no file changes → 🟢 Likely FP → Tune the rule
```

### 🧠 Memory Trick

> Think: **"U Got Caught? Verify Dude!"**

## 📊 Evidence Strength Quick Reference

| Strength | What You Have | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 🔴 **Strong TP** | TI-confirmed IOC + endpoint activity + user denies | Malicious hash on endpoint + C2 traffic + user says "wasn't me" |
| 🟠 **Moderate TP** | Suspicious behavior + no business justification | Off-hours admin login + no change ticket |
| 🟡 **Needs More Info** | Single indicator, no correlation | One failed login from unknown IP |
| 🟢 **Likely FP** | Business justification exists | IT admin patching servers after hours |
| ✅ **Confirmed FP** | User/IT confirms + matches known pattern | Vulnerability scanner triggered IDS alert |

## ✅ Post-Decision Actions

### If TP (True Positive)
- [ ] Follow the SANS IR steps: **Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons Learned**
- [ ] Document the incident timeline
- [ ] Collect all evidence and IOCs
- [ ] Escalate to the IR team if high severity
- [ ] Update threat intel feeds with new IOCs
- [ ] Notify management (if required)

### If FP (False Positive)
- [ ] Document **why** it's FP (for future reference)
- [ ] Tune the detection rule to reduce future FPs
- [ ] Add whitelist/exception if appropriate
- [ ] Close the alert with proper notes
- [ ] Track FP rate per rule (high FP rate = rule needs fixing)

> [!TIP]
> **Interview tip**: When explaining your TP/FP process, always structure your answer around the **U-G-C-V-D** framework. Interviewers love hearing a clear, repeatable methodology.
