2. iam:PutUserPolicy                        → Add inline admin policy to self
3. iam:CreateRole + sts:AssumeRole           → Create admin role, assume it
4. iam:PassRole + lambda:CreateFunction      → Pass admin role to Lambda
5. iam:PassRole + ec2:RunInstances           → Launch EC2 with admin instance profile
6. iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy               → Modify role trust to allow self
7. lambda:UpdateFunctionCode                 → Inject code into privileged Lambda
8. iam:CreateLoginProfile                    → Add console password to user
9. iam:CreateAccessKey                       → Create new keys for existing user
10. glue:UpdateDevEndpoint                   → Add SSH key to privileged Glue endpoint
```

#### Persistence Methods in AWS

| Method | CloudTrail Event | What to Check |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Create IAM user** | `CreateUser` + `CreateAccessKey` | Was this authorized? |
| **Create access key** | `CreateAccessKey` | For existing user — was a second key created? |
| **Create login profile** | `CreateLoginProfile` | Console access added to programmatic-only user? |
| **Create role with external trust** | `CreateRole` / `UpdateAssumeRolePolicy` | Trust allows unknown AWS accounts? |
| **Lambda with EventBridge trigger** | `CreateFunction` + `PutRule` + `PutTargets` | Scheduled Lambda running attacker code? |
| **EC2 instance with IAM role** | `RunInstances` + `AssociateIamInstanceProfile` | Persistent compute with stolen-role access? |
| **SSM document** | `CreateDocument` | Backdoor SSM run command document? |
| **CloudFormation stack** | `CreateStack` | Infrastructure as code for persistent resources? |

2. PERSISTENCE       → Modify role trust policy → add attacker's AWS account
3. LATERAL MOVEMENT  → AssumeRole from attacker's account
4. EXFILTRATION      → Access resources using the assumed role
```

**Detection Points**:
- CloudTrail: `UpdateAssumeRolePolicy` with external account ID
- Access Analyzer: Cross-account access finding
- GuardDuty: Unusual cross-account `AssumeRole`

**Response**:
1. Revert the trust policy
2. Disable the compromised IAM user
3. Audit all actions from the attacker's sessions
4. Use permission boundaries to prevent trust policy modifications

## 8. Universal AWS Alert Investigation Framework

### The 6-Step AWS Investigation Process (mnemonic: **W-I-C-C-V-D**)

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AWS CLOUD SECURITY INVESTIGATION                │
│                                                           │
│  Step 1: W — WHAT happened?                              │
│    → Read the GuardDuty / SecurityHub finding              │
│    → Identify the CloudTrail event name                    │
│    → Note: resource, region, account                       │
│                                                           │
│  Step 2: I — IDENTITY: Who did it?                       │
│    → CloudTrail → userIdentity (user/role/root?)           │
│    → Source IP, user agent, MFA status                     │
│    → Is this a known principal?                            │
│                                                           │
│  Step 3: C — CONTEXT: Is this normal?                    │
│    → Check time (business hours?)                          │
│    → Check location (expected region/IP?)                  │
│    → Check history (has this user done this before?)       │
│    → Check change management (is there a ticket?)          │
│                                                           │
│  Step 4: C — CORRELATE across sources                    │
│    → CloudTrail (API calls before & after)                 │
│    → VPC Flow Logs (network activity)                      │
│    → GuardDuty (other findings for same resource)          │
│    → AWS Config (resource state changes)                   │
│                                                           │
│  Step 5: V — VERIFY with humans                          │
│    → Contact the resource owner / team                     │
│    → Check with IAM admin                                  │
│    → Verify against deployment pipelines                   │
│                                                           │
│  Step 6: D — DECIDE and act                              │
│    → TP → Contain (isolate/disable), Eradicate, Recover   │
│    → FP → Document, tune the detection, close              │
│                                                           │

> [!TIP]
> **Interview tip**: When asked about AWS security, structure your answer around: **"Prevention (IAM, SGs, encryption) → Detection (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config) → Response (isolate, rotate, patch) → Recovery (restore, audit, improve)"**
