# 🎤 Self-Introduction: Cloud Security / CNAPP Engineer

**Name:** Gopi Krishna [Last Name]
**Target Role:** Application / Cloud Security Engineer (EY India)

---

## 1️⃣ THE QUICK HOOK (Elevator Pitch - 45 seconds)

> "Hi, I’m Gopi Krishna, a Cloud Security Engineer specializing in multi-cloud posture management and runtime protection across AWS, Azure, and GCP. In my current capacity, I leverage leading CNAPP platforms like CrowdStrike Falcon, Wiz, and Prisma to secure complex containerized environments, specifically Kubernetes and EKS. 
> 
> My core focus is bridging the gap between simply deploying security tools and actually driving measurable security outcomes. I handle the end-to-end lifecycle—from shift-left CI/CD integration and CSPM baseline enforcement, to runtime CWPP threat detection and incident response. 
> 
> What I bring to the table is a heavily automated, process-driven approach: I don't just triage alerts; I build the SLA frameworks, develop the Python automation playbooks, and tune the detection engines to ensure our engineering teams get high-fidelity signals and our infrastructure remains continuously compliant with frameworks like CIS and NIST."

## 2️⃣ WHAT I DO (Day-to-Day Activities - 1.5 minutes)

> "On a day-to-day basis, my activities are split between active threat monitoring, posture management, and stakeholder collaboration:

**Morning: Triage & Threat Investigation**
- I start by reviewing the CNAPP dashboard for new Critical or High indicators of attack (IOAs) and indicators of misconfiguration (IOMs).
- I use a strict decision framework to differentiate True Positives from False Positives—analyzing container process trees, network flows, and correlating CSPM findings with CIEM anomalies to catch multi-signal attack paths.
- For true threats, I initiate containment—such as isolating a compromised pod, revoking active STS sessions, or blocking public bucket access.

**Mid-Day: Remediation & Automation**
- I manage the vulnerability lifecycle. I don't just look at CVSS scores; I prioritize based on exploitability, internet exposure, and whether sensitive data is at risk.
- I route validated findings to engineering teams with specific remediation steps and strict SLAs (for example, 4 hours for a Critical public-facing CVE).
- I also write and maintain Python/Boto3 automation scripts to auto-remediate common issues, like closing 0.0.0.0/0 security groups or enforcing IAM key rotation.

**Afternoon: Posture, Tuning & Shift-Left**
- I continuously assess our compliance posture against CIS benchmarks and NIST 800-53.
- I tune our detection platforms. If a rule has a True Positive rate under 50%, I scope it down, refine the logic, or implement tightly controlled, documented suppressions to eliminate alert fatigue.
- I collaborate with DevOps to implement build-breaking policies—ensuring IaC and container images are scanned in the pipeline, backing that up with Kubernetes Admission Controllers (KAC) to prevent non-compliant deployments."

## 3️⃣ WHAT I CAN HANDLE (Capabilities & Scope - 1 minute)

> "In terms of scope and technical depth, I can handle:

1. **Complex Incident Response:** I can drive a container breach from identification to eradication. Whether it’s a container escape via `nsenter`, a compromised `kubeconfig`, or an IAM privilege escalation, I know how to contain the blast radius, preserve forensic evidence, and recover the environment securely.
2. **Zero-Day Emergencies:** When a critical zero-day drops, I can run an immediate blast radius assessment across all cloud accounts, pull affected asset lists, and deploy compensating controls like WAF rules or KAC blocks within hours while patching is underway.
3. **Multi-Cloud Governance:** I understand the native security controls of AWS, Azure, and GCP. I can map unified CNAPP policies down to AWS SCPs, Azure Management Groups, or GCP Organization Policies to enforce immutable guardrails.
4. **Kubernetes Workload Security:** I am deeply familiar with Pod Security Standards (PSS), configuring least-privilege RBAC, and utilizing eBPF-based sensors to monitor runtime behavior without disrupting production traffic."

## 4️⃣ WHAT I DELIVER (Outcomes & Value - 45 seconds)

> "Ultimately, what I deliver to the organization is continuous, provable security:

- **Actionable Alerts (>80% TP Rate):** By aggressively tuning rules and treating alert fatigue as a process failure, I deliver high-fidelity signals so engineers aren't chasing ghosts.
- **Enforced SLAs & Reduced MTTR:** I deliver a structured remediation framework. By integrating CNAPP directly with ticketing systems (like Jira/ServiceNow) and making risk visible, I significantly reduce the Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) for critical vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Audit Readiness:** I map every technical control and CSPM finding to compliance frameworks like CIS and NIST. This means we aren't scrambling before an audit; we can produce real-time compliance reports and evidence at any moment.
- **Secure DevOps Pipelines:** I deliver a frictionless 'shift-left' environment where security is a seamless gate in the CI/CD pipeline, catching secrets, malware, and misconfigurations before they ever reach production."

## 💡 Quick Tips for Delivery:
- **Pacing:** Don't rush. Pause between "What I do" and "What I can handle."
- **Adaptability:** If the interviewer specifically asks about a tool (like CrowdStrike or Wiz), explicitly name-drop it during the relevant section.
- **Confidence:** When you say "What I deliver," speak definitively. You are guaranteeing business value—lower risk, faster response, and compliance.
